Gear up for the [Code with Kiro Hackathon](https://kiro.devpost.com/?trk=b85f313f-a67c-452d-b088-07f0ddbd7e15&sc_channel=el). Kiro transforms your development workflow with seamless AI integration in a development environment that understands how you code. Come explore Kiro’s AI IDE and see what spec-driven development is all about, with $100,000 in prizes up for grabs. Your only limitation is how far your creativity can take you as Kiro scales your ideas through AI features like context-aware inline coding, multimodal chat, spec-driven development, and intelligent agent hooks capable of automating all kinds of tasks. Learn more about [Kiro’s unique AI features](/).

## Build (almost) whatever you want

To maximize your creative freedom, the main requirement of your project is simply to use Kiro to build a working app. We've got four categories to help get your creative juices flowing, but don't let these box you in:

- Productivity & Workflow Tools: Build the CLI of your dreams, the task tracker application that checks all your feature boxes, or design a scrum board that streamlines your team's process.
- Games & Entertainment: From rogue-likes to real-time multiplayer games, if it's fun, we want to see it.
- Educational Apps: Interactive coding tutorials, algorithm visualizers, or anything that makes learning enjoyable and engaging.
- Wildcard: Do you have a unique idea that doesn't fit anywhere else? This is your space. Surprise us.

## All skill levels welcome

If you can dream it, Kiro can help you realize it. We encourage developers of any skill level to join, whether as a solo developer or as a team (up to 3 members allowed) - this is your call for action. Still not sure if this is the right hackathon for you?

It takes all types of skill sets to build a successful application:

- Developers
- Startup founders or entrepreneurs
- Designers
- Students (high school to postgraduate)
- Basically, any builder

The beauty of AI-driven software engineering in the modern age is the accessibility across different levels of technical skills. Kiro works with you to bring out your strongest skills and enable you to take your projects from ideation to production code. But don’t take our word for it - try it for yourself, and maybe win some cash while you’re at it!

## Need we say more? ...okay

It’s no secret that AI is shaping the world around us like never before. Many tools are touting faster coding with AI, but it’s time for more than that. Kiro is an agentic IDE that’s built to be your development partner, elevating your work beyond just writing code faster. Get in on the cutting edge of [AI development with Kiro](/blog/introducing-kiro/) and grow your skills while bringing powerful solutions to the world.

Need more reasons to enter? Join the community and make new connections with fellow developers and industry experts who are shaping the future of development with AI. We'll have weekly office hours and Discord at the ready to support you, in addition to our tech docs and tutorials at [kiro.dev/docs](/docs/). Our panel of judges feature some of the community's best and brightest, including experts like [Tim Ruscica](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tim-ruscica/), [Aishwarya Srinivasan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aishwarya-srinivasan/), [Angie Jones](https://www.linkedin.com/in/angiejones/), [Santiago Valdarrama](https://www.linkedin.com/in/svpino), and [Jeff Barr](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeffbarr/).
