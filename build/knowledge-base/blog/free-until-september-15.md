Following our [pricing update on August 22nd](/blog/important-pricing-updates/), we are extending the free Kiro usage beyond September 1st, until September 15th.

This means you can continue to use Kiro for free until September 15th. We’ll refund the full amount for your September charge, so you can continue using Kiro for free. Your usage limits will reset on September 1st to the full limits of your plan as part of your regular subscription cycle.

Additionally, regardless of the paid pricing plan you are on, you will be able to turn on overages and benefit from 1,000 additional vibe and 200 spec requests free of cost through September 15th. Please see the FAQs below for more details.

Also, all refunds have been processed. We have also reset limits earlier this week as we are deploying improvements to the system. We hope this gives you more room to do meaningful work.

We have been listening to your feedback, and it has been very valuable to inform how we evolve the Kiro pricing model. Based on your input, we will be announcing updated pricing in the coming weeks and intend to roll out new pricing after September 15th. Before we roll out the new pricing changes, we will notify you of the upcoming changes so you can plan accordingly.

We’re making these changes to give everyone more time with the current experience while we incorporate your feedback in the pricing model. Thanks again for all your support — and please keep the feedback coming by joining [our Discord](https://discord.gg/kirodotdev).

## FAQs

##### When and how will customers be refunded?

If you have an active subscription with Kiro, your credit card will be charged on September 1st for September usage. We will refund the amount by September 15th.

##### Are you refunding overages too?

If you have already incurred overages in August, we will refund those. [Overages](https://kiro.dev/docs/billing/overages/) are temporarily capped to 1,000 vibe requests and 200 spec requests during September. If your credit card gets charged for overages, we will refund it at the end of September.

##### How and when will the usage be reset for customers?

Your monthly plan limits will reset on September 1st.

##### If I purchase a subscription today is it free until September 15th?

If you purchase a subscription anytime before September 14th, you can use it for free until September 14th. Your credit card will be charged, and we will refund those charges by September 15th. You can use the plan you purchased to the full monthly limits until September 15th.

##### Can I use Kiro for free in September?

If you’re already on a paid plan, your monthly limits are resetting on September 1st, and you can continue to use Kiro for free until September 15th to the full monthly limits.

If you are purchasing a paid plan between now and September 14th, you will need to provide a valid credit card, which will be charged the price of the plan you purchased, plus applicable taxes and fees. We will then refund you by September 15th, within a few days of your purchase. You can use Kiro within the full monthly plan limits you upgraded to for free. Unused requests will not roll over to the following months, or to the updated plans. We are working on tweaking our existing pricing plans to better meet your needs, and once we are ready to roll out the updates in the coming weeks, you will be migrated to the new plans, unless you cancel your subscription. We will communicate more details later in September.

##### Can I enable overages for free during September?

Yes, you can turn on overages. [Overages](/docs/billing/overages/) are temporarily capped to 1,000 vibe requests and 200 spec requests until September 15th. If your credit card gets charged for overages you incur until September 15th, we will refund it at the end of September.

##### What pricing updates can I expect in the coming weeks?

We are considering making changes to how spec and vibe requests work to ensure you get great mileage when using Kiro for common development tasks. We will communicate updates before we roll out pricing so you get a chance to decide if the changes work for you.

##### How does pro-rated billing work?

If a month has 30 days, and you sign up on day 20, you get charged for the remaining 10 days of the month, and get to use monthly limits accordingly. For example, if you subscribe to Kiro Plus on September 5th, since September has 30 days, you get charged 25/30 × $20 (Kiro Plus cost) = $16.67, and get 25/30 × 225 = 187 vibe requests and 25/30 × 125 = 104 spec requests.

##### I’m taking part in the Kiro hackathon, how do these changes affect me?

The [hackathon](https://kiro.devpost.com/) submission deadline is September 15th, and you can use Kiro for free until that date, within the same terms described in this announcement.
