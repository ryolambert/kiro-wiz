Starting today, you can use Claude Opus 4.6, Anthropic’s newest SoTA model, in the Kiro IDE and CLI. Opus 4.6 is Anthropic’s most powerful model yet and also the world’s best model for coding.

Opus 4.6 maintains everything you love about 4.5, while expanding its coding capabilities to become the best model for production code and sophisticated agents. It excels on large-scale codebases and long-horizon projects, helping senior engineers complete multi-day projects in hours by delegating complex tasks to Opus 4.6 with less oversight.

We see Opus 4.6 as the strongest model for Kiro’s spec-driven development workflows. With Opus 4.6 under the hood, Kiro is able to create detailed but precise specs on top of large existing projects, making updates with surgical precision with minimal user input.

Opus 4.6 is available [with experimental support](/docs/privacy-and-security/data-protection/#global-cross-region-inference-for-experimental-features) to all Kiro Pro, Pro+, and Power customers, logging in with Google, GitHub, AWS BuilderID and AWS IAM Identity Center. Opus 4.6 is available in the AWS US-East-1 (Northern Virginia) region, and features a 2.2x credit multiplier, the same as Claude Opus 4.5.

[Download Kiro](/downloads/) or restart the app or CLI to use the new model.
