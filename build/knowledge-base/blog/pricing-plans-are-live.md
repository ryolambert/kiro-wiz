Over the past few weeks, we have shared [several](/blog/pricing-waitlist-updates/) [important](/blog/understanding-kiro-pricing-specs-vibes-usage-tracking/) Kiro pricing updates. We made these updates to our pricing model in response to your feedback. Many in our community have asked for a way to use Kiro above and beyond the daily preview limits, while others have been eager to get off the waitlist and try Kiro for themselves. We’re making pricing plans available today, which means we can accelerate onboarding of all Kiro enthusiasts already on our waitlist, and give existing users more control over their Kiro usage.

## What this means for you

As of today, users logging in with Google, GitHub, or an AWS Builder ID account without a Q Developer subscription have been transitioned to our new pricing model. Those accounts are now on the Free tier, which includes 50 Vibe requests per month and 0 Spec requests.

We're also introducing a welcome bonus of 100 Spec requests and 100 Vibe requests for all users. This bonus is available within the first 14 days of usage on the new pricing plans, and starts counting from your first request, regardless of which tier you're on. This gives you time to experience Kiro's full capabilities and figure out your usage needs.

When you're ready to upgrade, you have three paid options:

## Monitoring your usage

You can monitor month-to-date usage against plan limits for both Vibe and Spec requests, track overage charges if enabled, and manage your subscription plan. Check out the Kiro documentation for more details.

## Upgrading your plan

When you’re ready, upgrading is simple:

1. Click your profile icon in Kiro and choose "Upgrade Plan"
2. Select your preferred plan (Pro, Pro+, or Power)
3. Enter your payment details and your new plan activates immediately

You can upgrade, downgrade, view your billing history, or update payment details at any point, and changes are immediate.

Not sure which plan to choose? Here is our recommendation:

- Getting started: Choose Pro and enable overages for flexibility while you learn your usage patterns.
- Known usage patterns: Choose the smallest plan that covers your typical monthly usage with some buffer.
- Fixed costs: Select the plan that covers your peak usage and disable overages. Usage pauses at your monthly limit and resets the following month.

## Important: make sure you upgrade to v0.2.13 or newer to get started

To access the new usage dashboard and manage your plan, [upgrade to Kiro v0.2.13 or newer](/downloads/) by clicking the settings icon in Kiro and choosing "Check for updates...".
