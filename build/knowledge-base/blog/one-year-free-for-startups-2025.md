Look, we get it. Moving from "hey, this prototype is pretty cool" to "woah, we can go from vibe coding to scaling a production app without breaking any code?" That's the startup struggle Kiro seeks to solve. Kiro transforms your "wouldn't it be cool if..." prompts into clear requirements, solid designs, and implementation tasks bringing structure to your AI coding workflows. No more crossing your fingers needing to worry if your code will break as your projects become more complex.

With Kiro, you can easily transition from vibe to spec mode and quickly bring your ideas from prototype to production. What’s more? Built and operated by AWS, Kiro benefits from the same security, reliability, and privacy standards and controls trusted by millions of customers. We're committed to making Kiro accessible for startups and so... we're dropping something **huge**.

## Introducing Our Kiro Pro+ Startup Credits Program

Starting today until December 31, 2025, we're giving qualifying startups credits for up to **one full year** of Kiro pro+ tier access to all our premium features. Available in most countries globally, we're offering three credit packages:

- 🌱 Starter Tier: Up to 2 Kiro users
- 🚀 Growth Tier: Up to 50 Kiro users
- ⭐ Scale Tier: Up to 100 Kiro users

We kept the application process simple. Fill out our form. If you're approved, you'll hear back from us, and credits automatically appear in your AWS account. Please note, if you select a plan greater than Kiro Pro+ upon receiving credits or exceed the number of users, you may be charged additional fees once credit allocations are exhausted.

## An Optimized Way to Build for Startups

We know startups thrive on speed and agility, but this often comes at the cost of organization. Kiro helps bring structure to the inevitable chaos of startup life. Built from the ground up for working with AI agents, Kiro gives you the best tool for the job in a fresh development experience that still feels familiar. You can use multimodal chat, and scale and automate tasks with agent hooks. And with specs, steering, and smart context management, Kiro understands the intent behind your prompts and helps you implement complex features on larger codebases, in fewer shots.

## What We Need from You

To access your Kiro Pro+ credits, you’ll need to:

- Be somewhere between "we have an idea and some funding" and Series B VC-backed
- Have an AWS account that matches your business domain
- Apply with your real business email

## Why We're Doing This (Spoiler: We Believe in You)

This isn't just about giving away free stuff. We want to invest in the next wave of companies that are going to build the future. The startup credits program is our bet on ambitious teams like yours.

## Ready to Build the Future with Us?

Applications for startup credits have now closed due to high demand. We are still reviewing applications on a rolling basis. Stay tuned for updates. [Learn more](/startups/). Credits expire one year after they're added to your account.

*Build faster, scale smarter, and have some fun along the way. The future of spec-driven development for AI coding is here, and we're making it accessible to everyone with big dreams and bigger ambitions.*
