Kiro’s Auto agent is now more efficient, letting you do more with your credits while maintaining the same high quality you expect from Kiro.

## More efficient Auto agent

Our goal with Kiro is to give you the best results at the best price. To achieve that, earlier we built Auto, an agent that uses a mix of different frontier models, such as Sonnet 4.5, combined with specialized models and optimization techniques such as intent detection, caching, and more. We hold a high bar for the quality of Auto, accepting nothing less than what a frontier model would provide. On 11/7, we shipped a new version of Auto, resulting in a substantial reduction for the credits you’re consuming for your requests. For typical everyday requests, customers saw a 21% reduction in credits used. For customers with the most demanding and complicated requests, they're using 36% less.

What does this mean for your day-to-day development? A typical request that previously used 1 credit now uses 0.79 credits. That means the existing credits on your Kiro plan can now accomplish around 20% more, giving you a longer runway for your development work for the same credits. Kiro user Andres Moreno, Principal Architect at Caylent and AWS Community Builder, said “I've definitely felt Kiro using fewer credits per request. It's been really nice, and it's also been super fast.”

If you're already using Auto, you're already realizing these savings. If you haven't tried Auto yet, now is the perfect time to start! And this is only the beginning. We're working on exciting improvements to Auto, including neuro-symbolic AI that combines neural networks with formal reasoning. These advances will help you write better requirements, validate implementations more effectively, and produce higher quality code all while keeping your credit usage efficient.
