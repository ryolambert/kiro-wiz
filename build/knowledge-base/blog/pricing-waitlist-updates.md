We're grateful for the incredible interest in Kiro! The community feedback has been amazing, and one thing is clear: you all want more. Those of you following along but still on the waitlist want a chance to test Kiro for yourselves, and those of you already using Kiro want more control over how much you can access. That's why we have two updates for the community that get to the heart of this:

1. Waitlist invites are starting: Beginning next week, we'll onboard waitlisted developers, giving more of you the opportunity to experience Kiro firsthand.
2. New pricing tiers are coming: Based on what we've learned from early preview users about their workflows and needs, we're introducing pricing tiers later this month, giving you the option to invest in additional capacity or continue using Kiro for free.

**Waitlist Update**

Thank you for your patience - we're almost ready to start sending invites! Next week, we'll begin emailing sign-up codes to those on our waitlist. You'll be able to use these codes to onboard and experience everything Kiro has to offer. When pricing tiers go live later this month, you'll automatically get access to our two-week free trial giving you plenty of time to explore how Kiro fits into your development workflow before deciding on a pricing tier. We’re working through our waitlist as quickly as possible.

**Pricing Update**

Our preview period helped us better understand real-world usage patterns, leading us to structure our pricing in alignment with developer needs around Kiro's two core actions: **Spec **and **Vibe**. We've seen developers do amazing things with Specs—they've been able to accomplish tasks that often take many vibe interactions to get right. This highlights Kiro's primary value: a spec-driven development approach where developers generate requirements and design specs, then execute them task-by-task to create production-ready code—all powered by Claude 4 Sonnet. The second way developers build with Kiro is through "vibe," our agentic chat experience for those who prefer a familiar, conversational approach to building with AI agents.

Building on these insights and usage patterns, we’ve created pricing tiers that support developers and teams at every stage of their journey with Kiro. Whether you're just starting with AI development or leading a large team building complex applications, our pricing model  is designed to support your growth from free trial through enterprise-level usage. This new structure was shaped by observing how developers work, creating a more intuitive experience for our growing community. The highlights:

- Two-Week Free Trial: All new users receive a two-week trial with access to both Vibe (50 requests with 100 request bonus) and Spec (100 request bonus), ensuring everyone can experience Kiro's complete feature set.
- New Tiered Structure: We're introducing a more flexible tiered system, including Free, Pro ($20/month), Pro+ ($40/month), and Power ($200/month) plans, allowing developers to choose the tier that best fits their needs.
- Separate Allocations for Vibe and Spec requests: Recognizing the distinct ways developers use Kiro's Vibe and Spec features, we're providing separate allocations for each in our paid tiers.
- Perpetual Free Tier: We're maintaining a free tier with access to 50 monthly Vibe requests, allowing developers to continue exploring Kiro's capabilities without cost barriers.
- Flexible Overages: Additional usage is available for all paid tiers at $0.04 per Vibe request and $0.20 per Spec request, ensuring you never hit a wall when you need Kiro most.

Vibe requests include chat-based interactions like code explanations and bug fixes, while Spec requests cover executing tasks within Kiro's structured development workflow. We'll continuously evaluate usage patterns and may adjust limits to better serve our community, always prioritizing our users' needs.

**A Note to Our Existing Preview Users**

Thank you to everyone who's been part of Kiro's free preview since launch. Your feedback on GitHub and Discord has been invaluable in shaping not just our pricing model, but the entire Kiro experience. We hope you've been enjoying building with Kiro over these past few weeks.

You can continue using Kiro for free over the next few weeks. Later this month, you’ll have the option to either select a paid tier for increased capacity or continue with the Free Tier.  We've designed these tiers based directly on the usage patterns and feedback we've seen from the community, so we're confident there's an option that fits how you work.

**Looking Ahead**

As we begin onboarding users from our [waitlist](https://kiro.dev/waitlist/), we're committed to making the transition smooth for everyone. In the coming days, we'll host office hours to help you maximize value from Kiro.

Stay tuned for more details on the official launch date. For any questions about the transition, view our [pricing information and FAQs](https://kiro.dev/pricing/), join our community discussions at [Discord](https://discord.gg/kirodotdev). We can’t wait to see what you build!
