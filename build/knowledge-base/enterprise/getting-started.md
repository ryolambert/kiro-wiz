# Onboarding quickstart

---

## Audience

Read this page, and the **Enterprise** section, if you're an administrator who wants to onboard your team to Kiro and manage their subscriptions.

For detailed onboarding instructions, see [Subscribe your team to Kiro](../subscribe).

## To onboard your team to Kiro

1. Create an AWS account if you don't have one already (see Create an AWS account).
2. Sign in to your AWS account. You can sign in as an AWS root user or as a user with a privileged role. Alternatively, allow adminitrators to use Kiro with minimum permissions.
3. Enable AWS IAM Identity Center in your AWS account. Add users to its directory, or connect it to an external identity provider (IdP). If this is your first time setting up an IAM Identity Center instance, see Getting started with IAM Identity Center.
4. Create a Kiro profile and subscribe users. Within the AWS console, navigate to the Kiro console and use the available UI to create a profile and subscribe users. The profile is the glue that ties your user identities with their Kiro subscriptions and settings. Once your Kiro profile is created and connected, you can import your users and groups and subscribe your team to Kiro.
5. Have users check their email. Within 24 hours of being subscribed, users should receive an email that contains download instructions for the Kiro IDE and Kiro CLI, as well as sign-in instructions.
