Effective hook management ensures your automation workflows remain organized, maintainable, and efficient as your project grows.

## Managing your hooks

Access all your hooks through the Agent Hooks section in the Kiro panel.

### Enable/disable hooks

Toggle hooks on/off without deleting them:

- Quick toggle: Click the eye icon next to any hook in the Agent Hooks panel
- From hook view: Select a hook and use the Hook Enabled switch in the top-right corner

### Edit existing hooks

Hooks evolve with your workflow. Update them anytime by selecting your hook in the Agent Hooks panel and modifying settings like triggers, file patterns, instructions, or descriptions. Updates apply immediately.

### Delete hooks

Select the hook in the Agent Hooks panel, click `Delete Hook` located at the bottom view, then click `delete`. This action cannot be undone.

### Run manual trigger hooks

You can execute a manual trigger hook using:

- Quick run: Click the play button (▷) next to the hook name in the Agent Hooks panel
- From hook view: Select the hook and click Start Hook in the top-right corner
