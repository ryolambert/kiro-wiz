# Chatting with the agent

---

You can chat with Kiro autonomous agent to discuss approaches, ask questions, and provide guidance before and during task execution.

## Before creating a task

Use chat to:

- Discuss different implementation approaches
- Clarify requirements or constraints
- Get the agent's input on technical decisions

The agent has access to web search, learnings from previous code reviews, and context from other tasks to provide informed responses.

## During task execution

Once a task is created, you can continue chatting to:

- Steer the agent on the implementation approach
- Provide additional requirements or constraints
- Ask the agent to do more work after reviewing initial results

Any comments or steering will update the scope of the current task. You cannot create a second task in the same chat—to work on a different task, start a new chat.
