## What are specs?

Specs or specifications are structured artifacts that formalize the development process for complex features in your application. They provide a systematic approach to transform high-level ideas into detailed implementation plans with clear tracking and accountability.

With Kiro's specs, you can:

- Break down requirements into user stories with acceptance criteria
- Build design docs with sequence diagrams and architecture plans
- Track implementation progress across discrete tasks
- Collaborate effectively between product and engineering teams

## Quickstart

Ready to create your first specification? Here's how to get started:

1. From the Kiro pane, click the + button under Specs. Alternatively, choose Spec from the chat pane.
2. Describe your project idea.
3. Follow the three phase workflow through Requirements → Design → Implementation.
