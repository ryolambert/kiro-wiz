# Code references

---

Kiro learns, in part, from open-source projects. Sometimes, a suggestion it's giving you may be similar to publicly available code. Code references include information about the source Kiro used to generate a recommendation.

This section describes how you can view, edit, and configure code references.

## View the code reference log

With the code reference log, you can view references to code recommendations that are similar to publicly available code. You can also edit code recommendations suggested by Kiro.

To view the code reference log:

1. Go to the Output tab in the status bar.
2. From the drop-down menu, choose code-references.

The code reference log only appears when you have code references enabled and Kiro has generated code with references.

## Turn code references on and off

Code references are disabled by default. To turn code references on or back off:

1. Open Settings in Kiro.
2. Switch to the User sub-tab.
3. Choose Kiro. You can also search for code references in the Settings search bar.
4. Under Code References: Reference Tracker, check or uncheck the box next to Allow Kiro to generate code with references.

## Opt out of code with references as an enteprise administrator

Kiro enterprise administrators can opt out of getting code suggestions with references for all users. Kiro enterprise users don't have control over this setting; it's controlled by the administrator and can't be overridden.

Administrators can opt out of code references in the Kiro console. For more information, see [Kiro enterprise settings](../../enterprise/settings).
