# Supported regions

There are two AWS Regions relevant to Kiro administrators:

- The Region where your IAM Identity Center instance is enabled. This is where user identities are managed, and where subscriptions are stored.
- The Region where your Kiro profile is created. This is where data is stored and inference is done, and might be different from your IAM Identity Center instance's Region.
