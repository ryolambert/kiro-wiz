# Contacting billing support

---

If you need assistance with billing questions, payment issues, subscription changes, or other account-related concerns, you can contact our billing support team directly.

## When to contact billing support

Contact billing support for help with:

- Payment issues - Failed payments, updating payment methods, or billing errors
- Subscription questions - Plan changes, upgrade/downgrade assistance, or billing cycle inquiries
- Account access - Issues accessing your account or billing dashboard
- Refund requests - Questions about refunds or billing disputes
- Usage clarification - Understanding your usage charges or tier limits
- Invoice questions - Requesting copies of invoices or clarifying charges

## How to contact support

You can contact billing support in two ways:

### Option 1: Command line

Use the Kiro CLI issue reporting command:

```bash
kiro-cli issue

```

### Option 2: From within chat

If you're already in a Kiro CLI chat session, you can use the built-in issue reporting tool to create a GitHub issue with pre-filled context. Just tell Kiro in natural language about the issue that you want to report, and it will help you create the issue on GitHub.

Both methods will help you create a support request that gets routed to our billing team.

## What information you'll need

When creating your support request, include:

- Issue title - Brief description of your billing concern
- Detailed description - Specific information about your billing question or issue
- Account details - Your Kiro account email and subscription information
- Context - Any relevant error messages or circumstances

## Tips for effective support requests

To help us resolve your issue quickly:

- Be specific - Clearly describe the billing problem you're experiencing
- Include relevant details - Account email, subscription tier, approximate dates of issues
- Mention previous attempts - Let us know if you've tried any troubleshooting steps

For general product questions or technical support, please refer to our [documentation](/docs) or visit our community forums [Discord](https://discord.gg/kirodotdev) and [GitHub](https://github.com/kirodotdev/kiro). Billing support specifically handles account, payment, and subscription-related inquiries.
