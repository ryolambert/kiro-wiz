# Subagents

---

Subagents are specialized agents that can autonomously execute complex tasks on your behalf. They have their own context, tool access, and decision-making capabilities, making them ideal for sophisticated multi-step operations.

## Key capabilities

- Autonomous execution - Run independently with their own context, with the level of autonomy depending on agent configuration
- Live progress tracking - Monitor real-time status updates as subagents work through tasks
- Core tool access - Read files, execute commands, write files, and use MCP tools
- Parallel execution - Run multiple subagents simultaneously for efficient task execution
- Result aggregation - Results automatically returned to the main agent when complete

## Default subagent

Kiro includes a default subagent that can handle general-purpose tasks. When you assign a task to a subagent, the default subagent is used unless you specify a custom agent configuration.

## Custom subagents

You can spawn subagents using your own agent configurations. This allows you to create specialized subagents tailored to specific workflows:

```bash
> Use the backend agent to refactor the payment module

```

To use a custom agent as a subagent, reference it by name when assigning tasks. The subagent will inherit the tool access and settings from that agent's configuration.

## How subagents work

1. Task assignment - You describe a task, and Kiro determines if a subagent is appropriate
2. Subagent initialization - The subagent is created with its own context and tool access based on its agent configuration
3. Autonomous execution - The subagent works through the task independently, though it may pause to request user approval for certain tool permissions
4. Progress updates - You receive live progress updates showing current work
5. Result return - When complete, results are returned to the main agent

## Tool availability

Subagents run in a separate runtime environment. Some tools available in normal chat are not yet implemented in subagents.

**Available tools:**

- read - Read files and directories
- write - Create and edit files
- shell - Execute bash commands
- MCP tools

**Not available:**

- web_search - Web research
- web_fetch - Fetch URLs
- introspect - CLI info
- thinking - Reasoning tool
- todo_list - Task tracking
- use_aws - AWS commands
- grep - Search file contents
- glob - Find files by pattern

If your custom agent configuration includes tools that aren't available in subagents, those tools will simply be unavailable when the agent runs as a subagent. The agent will still function with the available tools.

## Configuring subagent access

You can control which agents are available as subagents and which can run without permission prompts.

### Restricting available agents

Use `availableAgents` to limit which agents can be spawned as subagents:

```json
{
  "toolsSettings": {
    "subagent": {
      "availableAgents": ["reviewer", "tester", "docs-*"]
    }
  }
}

```

With this configuration, only the `reviewer`, `tester`, and agents matching `docs-*` can be used as subagents. Glob patterns are supported.

### Trusting specific agents

Use `trustedAgents` to allow specific agents to run without permission prompts:

```json
{
  "name": "orchestrator",
  "description": "Agent that coordinates multiple specialized subagents",
  "tools": ["fs_read", "subagent"],
  "toolsSettings": {
    "subagent": {
      "trustedAgents": ["reviewer", "tester", "analyzer"]
    }
  }
}

```

With this configuration, the orchestrator agent can spawn the `reviewer`, `tester`, and `analyzer` subagents without requiring user approval each time. Glob patterns like `test-*` are supported.

### Combining both settings

You can use both settings together for fine-grained control:

```json
{
  "toolsSettings": {
    "subagent": {
      "availableAgents": ["reviewer", "tester", "analyzer", "docs-*"],
      "trustedAgents": ["reviewer", "tester"]
    }
  }
}

```

This allows four agents to be spawned as subagents, but only `reviewer` and `tester` run without prompts.

## Best practices

1. Use for complex tasks - Most valuable for multi-step operations that benefit from isolation
2. Provide clear instructions - Specific task descriptions lead to better results
3. Monitor progress - Check on long-running subagents periodically
4. Review results - Verify subagent output before acting on recommendations

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
| --- | --- |
| Subagent not starting | Verify the task description is clear and actionable |
| Missing tool access | Check if the required tool is available in subagent runtime (see table above) |
| Incomplete results | Provide more specific instructions or break into smaller tasks |
