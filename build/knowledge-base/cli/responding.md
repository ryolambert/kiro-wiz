# Responding to messages

---

## Overview

Kiro CLI provides a convenient way to respond to specific parts of Kiro's previous message through the `/reply` command. It opens an editor with Kiro's last response quoted with > prefixes, allowing you to easily address individual points or provide structured feedback.
The command uses your system's default editor, and falls back to `vi` if no editor is configured

### How it works

- Retrieves last response: Finds the most recent assistant message from the conversation
- Formats with quotes: Each line is prefixed with > for clear attribution
- Opens editor: Your default editor opens with the quoted content
- Edit and respond: Add your responses below or interspersed with the quoted text
- Submit: When you save and close the editor, your response is submitted

### Editor behavior

- Pre-populated content: Editor opens with Kiro's response already quoted
- Quote format: Each line prefixed with > for clear visual distinction
- Flexible editing: Add content anywhere - below quotes, between lines, or interspersed
- Auto-submission: Content is automatically submitted when editor closes successfully

### Use cases

#### Responding to multiple questions

When Kiro asks several clarifying questions, use `/reply` to address each one:

```
> What programming language are you using?
Python

> What framework are you working with?
Django

> What specific error are you encountering?
I'm getting a 404 error when trying to access my API endpoints.


```

#### Addressing specific points

When Kiro provides a detailed explanation, respond to specific parts:

```
> Here are three approaches you could take:
> 1. Use a database migration
> 2. Update the model directly
> 3. Create a custom management command

I'd like to go with option 1. Can you show me how to create the migration?

> Make sure to backup your data first.
Already done - I have a full backup from this morning.

```

#### Providing structured feedback

When Kiro suggests multiple changes, organize your responses clearly:

```
> I recommend these improvements:
> - Add error handling for network requests
> - Implement input validation
> - Add logging for debugging

Agreed on all points. For the error handling:
- Should I use try/catch blocks or a decorator pattern?

For logging:
- What level of detail do you recommend?

```

### Status messages

The command provides clear feedback about its operation:

- Success: "Content loaded from editor. Submitting prompt..."
- No changes: "No changes made in editor, not submitting."
- No message: "No assistant message found to reply to."
- Editor error: "Error opening editor: [specific error details]"

### Error handling

- No assistant message: Shows warning if no previous Kiro response is found
- Editor failures: Reports editor process failures with specific error details
- Empty content: Detects when no changes are made and skips submission
- Unchanged content: Compares with initial text to avoid submitting unmodified quotes

### Best practices

- Use /reply when Kiro's response contains multiple points that need individual attention
- Keep your responses clear and organized when addressing quoted sections
- Focus on sections that need clarification rather than responding to every quoted line
- Use the quote structure to maintain context in longer conversations

1. You can delete quote lines you don't need to respond to
2. Add blank lines between your responses for better readability
3. Use the quoted structure to break down complex topics into manageable parts
4. The command works best when Kiro's previous response was substantial and detailed
