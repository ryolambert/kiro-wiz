# Completions & autocomplete

---

Kiro CLI provides two AI-powered assistance features to help you work more efficiently in your terminal:

- Autocomplete Dropdown Menu: A graphical menu showing available command options
- Inline Suggestions: Gray "ghost text" that appears as you type

These features work independently and support hundreds of popular command line tools including `git`, `npm`, `docker`, and `aws`.

## Autocomplete dropdown menu

The autocomplete dropdown appears to the right of your cursor when typing commands, showing available options, subcommands, and arguments that you can select using arrow keys.

### Using autocomplete

The autocomplete dropdown is automatically enabled after you install Kiro CLI:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt
2. Start typing a command
3. A graphical menu will appear showing available options
4. Use arrow keys to navigate suggestions
5. Press Tab or Enter to select an option

### Configuration

Customize the autocomplete behavior:

```bash
# Enable/disable autocomplete
kiro-cli settings autocomplete.disable false  # enable
kiro-cli settings autocomplete.disable true   # disable

# Change theme
kiro-cli theme dark
kiro-cli theme light  
kiro-cli theme system

# View current theme
kiro-cli theme

# List available themes
kiro-cli theme --list

```

## Inline suggestions

Inline suggestions appear as gray "ghost text" directly on your command line as you type. This feature works independently from the dropdown menu.

### Using inline suggestions

Inline suggestions are enabled by default:

1. Start typing a command
2. Gray ghost text will appear showing potential completions
3. Press the right arrow key or Tab to accept
4. Continue typing to ignore the suggestion

### Managing inline suggestions

Control inline suggestions with the `kiro-cli inline` command:

```bash
# Enable inline suggestions
kiro-cli inline enable

# Disable inline suggestions  
kiro-cli inline disable

# Check current status
kiro-cli inline status

# Set customization
kiro-cli inline set-customization [ARN]

# Show available customizations
kiro-cli inline show-customizations

```
