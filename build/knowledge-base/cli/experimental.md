# Experimental features

---

Kiro CLI includes experimental features that provide advanced functionality. These features are in active development and can be toggled on/off using the `/experiment` command.

These features may change or be removed at any time. The experience might not be perfect. Use at your own discretion in production workflows.

These features are provided to gather feedback and test new capabilities. Please report issues through the `kiro issue` command.

## Managing experiments

Use the `/experiment` command to toggle experimental features:

```bash
/experiment

```

This shows an interactive menu where you can:

- See current status of each experiment (ON/OFF)
- Toggle experiments by selecting them
- View descriptions of what each experiment does

## Available experiments

### Knowledge management

**Command:** `/knowledge`

Enables persistent context storage and retrieval across chat sessions with semantic search capabilities.

**Features:**

- Store and search through files, directories, and text content
- Semantic search for better context retrieval
- Persistent knowledge base across sessions
- Agent-specific knowledge isolation

**Enable:**

```bash
kiro-cli settings chat.enableKnowledge true

```

[Learn more about Knowledge Management →](/docs/cli/experimental/knowledge-management)

### Tangent mode

**Command:** `/tangent` or **Ctrl+T**

Create conversation checkpoints to explore side topics without disrupting your main conversation flow.

**Features:**

- Create conversation checkpoints
- Explore tangential topics
- Return to main conversation thread
- Preserve conversation context

**Enable:**

```bash
kiro-cli settings chat.enableTangentMode true

```

[Learn more about Tangent Mode →](/docs/cli/experimental/tangent-mode)

### TODO lists

**Tool:** `todo` | **Command:** `/todo`

Enables Kiro to create and modify TODO lists automatically, with commands for you to view and manage them.

**Features:**

- Kiro automatically creates TODO lists when appropriate
- View, manage, and delete TODOs
- Resume existing TODO lists
- Persisted across chat sessions

**Enable:**

```bash
kiro-cli settings chat.enableTodoList true

```

[Learn more about TODO Lists →](/docs/cli/experimental/todo-lists)

### Thinking tool

Shows AI reasoning process for complex problems with step-by-step thought processes.

**Features:**

- Transparent decision-making process
- Step-by-step reasoning display
- Useful for debugging and learning
- Better understanding of conclusions

**Enable:**

```bash
kiro-cli settings chat.enableThinking true

```

### Checkpointing

**Command:** `/checkpoint`

Enables session-scoped checkpoints for tracking file changes using Git-like commands.

**Features:**

- Snapshots file changes into shadow git repo
- List, expand, diff, and restore checkpoints
- Conversation history unwinds when restoring
- Auto-enables in git repositories
- Manual initialization for non-git directories

**Enable:**

```bash
kiro-cli settings chat.enableCheckpoint true

```

**Basic Usage:**

```bash
/checkpoint list                    # Show checkpoints
/checkpoint expand <tag>            # Show detailed checkpoint info
/checkpoint diff <tag1> [tag2]      # Compare checkpoints
/checkpoint restore [<tag>]         # Restore to checkpoint
/checkpoint clean                   # Delete session shadow repo

```

### Context usage percentage

Shows context window usage as a percentage in the chat prompt with color-coded indicators.

**Features:**

- Displays percentage in prompt (e.g., "[rust-agent] 6% >")
- Color-coded indicators:
  - Green: Less than 50% usage
  - Yellow: 50-89% usage
  - Red: 90-100% usage
- Helps monitor context consumption

**Enable:**

```bash
kiro-cli settings chat.enableContextUsageIndicator true

```

### Delegate

Launch and manage asynchronous task processes, running Kiro chat sessions with specific agents in parallel.

**Features:**

- Launch background tasks using natural language
- Run parallel chat sessions with specific agents
- Monitor task progress independently
- Agent approval flow for security

**Enable:**

```bash
kiro-cli settings chat.enableDelegate true

```

**Usage:**
Use natural language to ask Kiro to launch a background task:

```
Can you create a background task to analyze the performance of our API endpoints?

```

Then check on results:

```
Check the status of my API analysis task
Show me the results from the background analysis

```

## Settings integration

Experiments are stored as settings and persist across sessions:

```bash
# View all experimental settings
kiro-cli settings list | grep -i enable

# Enable/disable specific experiments
kiro-cli settings chat.enableKnowledge true
kiro-cli settings chat.enableTangentMode true
kiro-cli settings chat.enableTodoList true
kiro-cli settings chat.enableThinking true
kiro-cli settings chat.enableCheckpoint true
kiro-cli settings chat.enableContextUsageIndicator true
kiro-cli settings chat.enableDelegate true

```

## Fuzzy search support

All experimental commands are available in fuzzy search (Ctrl+S):

- /experiment - Manage experimental features
- /knowledge - Knowledge base commands (when enabled)
- /todo - TODO list commands (when enabled)
- /tangent - Tangent mode toggle (when enabled)
- /checkpoint - Checkpoint commands (when enabled)

## Best practices

1. Test in safe environments: Try experimental features on non-critical projects first
2. Provide feedback: Report issues and suggestions using kiro issue
3. Stay updated: Check release notes for changes to experimental features
4. Understand limitations: Read individual feature documentation for known issues
5. Have backups: Some features modify files (checkpointing, TODO lists)

## Troubleshooting

### Feature not working

1. Verify feature is enabled:
bashkiro-cli settings list | grep -i enable
2. Check for error messages in chat
3. Try disabling and re-enabling:
bashkiro-cli settings chat.enableFeatureName false
kiro-cli settings chat.enableFeatureName true
4. Restart Kiro CLI

### Commands not available

Ensure the feature is enabled before using its commands. For example, `/knowledge` only works when knowledge management is enabled.
