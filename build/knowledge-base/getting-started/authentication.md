# Authentication methods

---

Kiro supports the following authentication providers:

- GitHub: Seamless integration with your GitHub account
- Google: Sign in with your Google credentials
- AWS Builder ID: Quick setup for individual developers
- AWS IAM Identity Center: Enterprise-grade authentication

Users that have a paid Kiro subscription and access it through a social login provider (like GitHub or Google) or through AWS Builder ID are considered *individual subscribers*. We may use certain content from Kiro Free Tier and Kiro individual subscribers for service improvement. For more information on service improvement and how to opt out, see [Service improvement](/docs/privacy-and-security/data-protection/#service-improvement).

Kiro is an AWS application that works as a standalone agentic IDE without needing to set up an AWS account. You can download and use Kiro immediately without any external account setup - it handles AI interactions and code assistance directly through the application itself. Whether you're developing with other AWS services or not, you can leverage Kiro's full capabilities to enhance your development workflow.
