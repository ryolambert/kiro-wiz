# Installation

---

## Download Kiro

Getting started is simple:

1. Go to kiro.dev and download the installer
2. Open the downloaded file and follow the installation instructions for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
3. Open Kiro IDE and start coding!

## First run

1. When you open Kiro for the first time you will be asked to login with a provider of your choice that include social and AWS login options. Learn more about the auth methods.
2. Once logged in, you can choose to import your VS Code settings and extensions. If you're using another editor, you can skip this step. Select your preferred theme from the available options, then allow Kiro to set up shell integration, enabling the agent to execute commands on your behalf.
3. Finally, you'll arrive at the welcome page. Open a project to get started and proceed with your first project.

## Language support

Kiro supports most popular programming languages. We have guides that help set up your environment and best practices for the following languages:

- TypeScript and JavaScript
