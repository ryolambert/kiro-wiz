# Vibe vs Spec sessions

---

## What is a Vibe session?

Vibe sessions are interactive Q&A-focused sessions in Kiro that are designed for quick questions, explanations, and building projects through a more conversational approach.

### How to access

You can switch between Vibe sessions and Spec sessions using the session picker when you launch a new session. This allows you to choose the interaction style that best suits your current task.

### When to Vibe

1. Interactive Q&A Format: Vibe sessions are optimized for back-and-forth conversations about code, allowing you to ask questions and get immediate responses.
2. Quick Assistance: They're ideal for getting quick answers to coding questions, explanations of code behavior, or understanding concepts without going through a formal specification process.
3. Contextual Understanding: Like other Kiro sessions, Vibe sessions leverage context providers to understand your codebase, but with a focus on explanation rather than extensive code generation.
4. Flexible Approach: Vibe sessions offer a more fluid, less structured approach compared to Spec sessions, making them suitable for exploratory coding and learning.

## What is a Spec session?

A Spec session guides you through a structured approach to complex development tasks in Kiro that formalizes the software development process. It transforms high-level ideas into detailed implementation plans with systematic execution and clear tracking.

### How to access

You can switch between Spec sessions and Vibe sessions using the session picker when you launch a new session. For complex development tasks, Spec sessions provide the structure needed to ensure thorough implementation.

### When to Spec

1. Complex Development Tasks: Use Spec sessions for building complex features, entire applications, or significant refactoring that requires careful planning and execution.
2. Structured Approach: When you need a methodical, step-by-step approach to development with clear documentation of requirements and implementation details.
3. Team Collaboration: For projects where multiple team members need to understand the implementation plan and track progress against specifications.
4. Documentation Needs: When you want to generate detailed documentation alongside your code implementation for future reference or knowledge sharing.
