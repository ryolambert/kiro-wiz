# Model selection

---

Kiro provides multiple powerful AI agent options to handle your development tasks: **Auto**, **Claude Sonnet 4.0**, **Claude Sonnet 4.5**, **Claude Opus 4.5**, and **Claude Haiku 4.5**. Each offers distinct advantages depending on your needs and usage patterns.

## Available models

### Auto (recommended)

Auto is Kiro's default intelligent model router that combines multiple frontier models with advanced optimization techniques.

**Key benefits:**

- Cost-effective – Approximately 23% less expensive than direct Sonnet 4 usage
- Smart routing – Automatically chooses the optimal model for each task
- Consistent quality – Delivers Sonnet 4-level results across different task types
- Plan efficiency – Makes your usage limits go further

#### What model does Auto use?

Auto uses best in class LLM models (Claude Sonnet 4 and alike) to provide you the best quality for the type of tasks assigned to the agent. We maintain a very high bar to ensure that the quality of what is offered under Auto compares to or exceeds the quality of separate models made available to our users.

### Claude Sonnet 4.0

Direct access to Anthropic's Claude Sonnet 4.0 model for users who prefer consistent model selection or have specific requirements for using this particular model.

**Key benefits:**

- Predictable behavior – Same model for all interactions
- Direct access – No routing or optimization layers
- Full control – Complete transparency in model selection

### Claude Sonnet 4.5

Anthropic's best model for complex agents and coding, with the highest intelligence across most tasks.

**Key benefits:**

- Coding excellence – Advanced state-of-the-art on SWE-bench Verified
- Agent capabilities – Extended autonomous operation for hours with effective tool usage
- Enhanced reasoning – Improved planning, system design, and security engineering

### Claude Opus 4.5

Anthropic's most intelligent model combining maximum capability with practical performance. Ideal for complex specialized tasks, professional software engineering, and advanced agents.

Claude Opus 4.5 is available exclusively to Pro, Pro+, and Power tier subscribers.

**Key benefits:**

- Maximum intelligence – Step-change improvements in reasoning, coding, and problem-solving
- Practical performance – More accessible price point than previous Opus models
- Complex reasoning – Better balance of tradeoffs and ambiguity across multiple systems
- Production-ready – Handles the most sophisticated software development challenges

### Claude Haiku 4.5

Anthropic's fastest and most intelligent Haiku model with near-frontier performance. Delivers intelligence matching Sonnet 4 at significantly lower cost and faster speed.

**Key benefits:**

- Near-frontier intelligence – Matches Sonnet 4 performance across reasoning and coding
- Blazing speed – More than twice the speed of Sonnet 4
- Cost-effective – Near-frontier intelligence at one-third the cost
- Extended thinking – First Haiku model with advanced reasoning capabilities

## Cost comparison

Understanding the credit consumption differences:

| Model | Credit Usage | Example Task Cost |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Claude Haiku 4.5 | 0.4x | 4 credits |
| Auto | 1.0x | 10 credits |
| Claude Sonnet 4.0 | 1.3x | 13 credits |
| Claude Sonnet 4.5 | 1.3x | 13 credits |
| Claude Opus 4.5 | 2.2x | 22 credits |

## Choosing the right model

### Haiku 4.5

Consider using Haiku 4.5 when:

- Speed is critical – You need fast responses for interactive experiences
- Cost efficiency matters – Near-frontier intelligence at one-third the cost
- High-volume processing – Cost-effective intelligence for large-scale deployments
- Real-time applications – Fast turnaround for user-facing features

### Auto

Consider using Auto when:

- Cost efficiency matters – You want to maximize your plan's value
- General development work – Most coding, debugging, and planning tasks
- Variable task types – Working on diverse projects with different requirements
- Plan optimization – You want your limits to stretch further

### Sonnet 4.0 & Sonnet 4.5

Consider using Sonnet 4.0 or Sonnet 4.5 when:

- Consistency is critical – You need predictable model behavior
- Specific requirements – Your workflow depends on Sonnet 4's particular capabilities
- Model transparency – You prefer knowing exactly which model handles each request
- Budget flexibility – Higher costs aren't a primary concern

### Opus 4.5

Consider using Opus 4.5 when:

- Maximum intelligence needed – Most complex specialized tasks requiring top-tier reasoning
- Professional software engineering – Sophisticated production development challenges
- Advanced agents – Long-running autonomous tasks with complex decision-making
- Critical implementations – High-stakes features where quality is paramount

## How to switch models

### In the chat interface

1. Access model selector
  - Look for the model dropdown in the chat interface
  - Default selection is Auto
2. Choose your model
  - Select Haiku 4.5 for fast, cost-effective tasks
  - Select Auto for intelligent routing
  - Select Claude Sonnet 4.0 for direct access
  - Select Claude Sonnet 4.5 for the latest Anthropic model
  - Select Claude Opus 4.5 for complex production tasks
3. Confirmation
  - Your selection applies to subsequent messages
  - Current conversation context is maintained

## Best practices

### Maximizing efficiency

- Start with Auto – Use it as your default for most tasks
- Use Haiku for speed – Near-frontier intelligence with fast responses and lower cost
- Use Sonnet for agents – Best for complex coding and autonomous workflows
- Reserve Opus for maximum intelligence – Use for the most complex specialized tasks
- Monitor usage – Track how different models affect your plan consumption
- Experiment – Try different models for similar tasks to compare results

### Cost management

- Plan accordingly – Factor model choice into your tier selection
- Track patterns – Understand which tasks benefit most from each model
- Optimize workflows – Adjust development practices based on model strengths
- Consider overages – Enable if you need flexibility beyond plan limits
