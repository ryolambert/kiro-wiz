# Conclusion

---

In this guide you got hands on with a range of Kiro features
including:

- Steering files, to guide AI agents through a complex project
- Basic vibe coding, for bug fixes and simple changes or refactors
- Specification driven development, to plan the requirements, design, and tasks for large changes
- Hooks, for when you want to automate common boilerplate tasks in your project
- MCP, for when you want to extend Kiro with new abilities and behaviors

## Next steps

Although you have completed this guide, there is still plenty
to build. Check out [the game roadmap](https://github.com/kirodotdev/spirit-of-kiro/blob/main/docs/ROADMAP.md)
for ideas. See if you can build any of these new features
using Kiro, and open a PR back to the project to contribute!
