# Migrating from VSCode

---

Built on Visual Studio Code's open source foundation, Kiro delivers AI-enhanced development capabilities while preserving the familiar interface you know. This shared architecture ensures a smooth transition when bringing your existing VS Code configuration to Kiro.

## Profile migration

Kiro's VS Code foundation enables complete compatibility with your development environment. You can transfer your personalized setup—extensions, themes, configurations, and shortcuts—with no compatibility concerns.

### Manual profile migration

For cross-machine transfers or granular control over your configuration, leverage VS Code's native profile export/import capabilities.

#### Exporting a profile from vs code

1. Launch the Command Palette in VS Code (⌘/Ctrl + Shift + P).
2. In the Command Palette, enter and select "Preferences: Open Profiles (UI)".
3. Locate your desired profile in the sidebar.
4. Access the 3-dot menu and choose Export.
5. Save locally or publish to a GitHub Gist.

**VS Code Settings**

- Access the same way: Command Palette (⌘/Ctrl + Shift + P) → "Preferences: Open Settings (UI)"
- Your standard VS Code preferences remain fully functional alongside Kiro settings

### Version updates

Kiro stays synchronized with VS Code's development cycle through regular rebasing. While we incorporate the latest features and improvements, we strategically select stable VS Code releases to ensure reliability alongside our AI enhancements.

## Extension compatibility

Kiro uses the OpenVSX extension registry, ensuring compatibility with open-source extensions. Extensions available in OpenVSX will migrate seamlessly, with many gaining enhanced capabilities through Kiro's AI integration:

- Language extensions: Full functionality preserved for OpenVSX-available extensions
- Theme extensions: Complete visual compatibility with OpenVSX themes
- Debugging extensions: Uninterrupted debugging workflows for compatible extensions
- Git extensions: Augmented with intelligent commit generation and automated code review

Only extensions available in the OpenVSX registry can be imported. Some VS Code Marketplace exclusives may not be available in Kiro.
