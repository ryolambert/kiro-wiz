# Meet Kiro.

Kiro is an agentic development environment that makes it easy for developers to ship real engineering work with the help of AI agents. Kiro is our answer to the question “what would a development environment look like if it could take full advantage of AI?”

We see agents as the most powerful tool yet developed for building software. We imagine a future where agents are deeply integrated across the software development lifecycle, but current IDEs don’t fully capture this transformative shift. Agents need more structured input and contextual information than a natural language prompt to build the right thing. While they're becoming increasingly capable of handling complex tasks independently, we lack the right interfaces and interaction methods to collaborate with agents effectively at scale. These are among the key challenges we're working to solve.

Through Kiro, we reinvented how developers work with AI agents. We pioneered spec-driven development, where Kiro turns your prompt into structured requirements, design, and tasks that are then implemented by agents. Kiro’s agent hooks help you scale your work by delegating tasks to agents that run in the background, such as updating docs, generating unit tests, or optimizing your code for performance. We see Kiro as a true collaborator that doesn’t just do work for you, but builds alongside you. Our goal is for Kiro to help you deliver robust engineering work while also helping you become an even better engineer.

Kiro is built and operated by a small, opinionated team within AWS. We chose the name ‘Kiro’ (rhymes with ‘hero’) because, among other meanings, it represents a hardworking person who never gives up. The name ‘Kiro’ embodies our north star: to move quickly and iterate relentlessly on delivering a remarkable AI-powered development experience for everyone. We’re excited to see what you build with Kiro.
