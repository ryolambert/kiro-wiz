# Deleting your account

Permanently deleting your Kiro account will remove all your custom settings and cancel any active subscription. This action cannot be undone.

**To delete your account**

1. In Kiro, open the command palette:
  - Mac: Cmd + Shift + P
  - Windows/Linux: Ctrl + Shift + P
2. Search > Kiro: Delete Account and select it.
3. (Optional) You'll have 30 days to restore your account. To restore your account, log back into Kiro during the 30-day period and settle any outstanding balance before upgrading to paid tiers.
4. After 30 days without logging back in, your account and data will be permanently deleted.
