### Works autonomously

Let Kiro autonomously handle development tasks while you stay focused or step away.

### Maintains context

Return to a task and pick up where you left off, without rebuilding context.

### Executes across repos

Create a task and Kiro handles the planning and implementation across all repos.

Runs tasks in isolated sandbox environments and opens pull requests for review, so work progresses while you stay focused on your current work

Maintains context across tasks, repositories, and pull requests, and uses your review feedback to shape future changes so it better matches how you and your team build software

Plan a change once and let Kiro create coordinated edits and pull requests, landing related updates together across repositories instead of one at a time

## Kiro autonomous agent for teams

### Protects focus time

Handles routine fixes, follow-ups, and status updates so engineers face fewer interruptions and maintain longer blocks for deep work

### Learns from your team

Continuously learns from your codebase, tickets, and feedback to better align with your team's development patterns
