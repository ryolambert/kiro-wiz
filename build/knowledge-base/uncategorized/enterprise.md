With [spec-driven development](/docs/specs/concepts/), [advanced context management](/docs/chat/#context-management), and [collaborative agents](/docs/cli/custom-agents/), your team can iterate faster with increased quality, while minimizing risk.

### Escape velocity without the tech debt

Align your entire team with [executable specs](/docs/specs/) as the source of truth. Then, unleash powerful [agents in the IDE](/docs/chat/model-selection/) and [CLI](/docs/cli/custom-agents/) that work alongside you to reduce friction and solve difficult problems. Increase your team development velocity while enforcing best practices with powerful agent [steering](/docs/steering/) and [hooks](/docs/hooks/).

From startups to enterprises, Kiro is the secret behind teams who experience 10x their usual output.

> We began using Kiro to enhance our modernization efforts, and the results were impressive – we completed 52 weeks of estimated work in just three weeks, resulting in a 90% increase in efficiency.

### Flexible administration

Easily [manage subscriptions](/docs/enterprise/subscription-management/), [access](/docs/enterprise/iam/), [permissions](/docs/enterprise/iam/#identity-based-policies-for-kiro), and [billing](/docs/enterprise/billing/) at the org level. Kiro is [available in](/docs/enterprise/supported-regions/) the US East (N. Virginia) and Europe (Frankfurt) AWS Regions.

### Backed by AWS security best practices

Kiro is designed, built, and operated by following the same [security](/docs/privacy-and-security/), [governance](/docs/privacy-and-security/compliance-validation/), and [encryption standards](/docs/privacy-and-security/infrastructure-security/) as the AWS cloud infrastructure.

### IP Indemnity

Kiro offers indemnity for its output, so Pro, Pro+, and Power subscribers can ship quality software with confidence. See [Service Terms](https://aws.amazon.com/service-terms/) for details.

## Ship faster across the entire development lifecycle

Kiro helps [maintain living docs](/docs/steering/) and tests across large codebases, so it's easy to get new teammates up to speed.

[Trace and fix bugs](/docs/chat/diagnostics/) in minutes to minimize blast radius and move on to interesting tasks.

Kiro helps [break down complex features](/docs/specs/) into manageable tasks so your team can ship their best work with ease.

## Integrate with the tools you need

### MCP

Connect to the web, APIs, databases, docs, cloud platforms, [and more](/docs/cli/mcp/).

### Terminal

Use [Kiro CLI](/cli) with bash, zsh, fish, and [over 500 popular CLIs](/docs/cli/autocomplete/).

### Pipelines

Integrate and trigger the Kiro CLI [within your CI/CD pipelines](/docs/cli/custom-agents/).

### Extensions

Kiro supports [Open VSX extensions, themes, and VS Code settings](/docs/guides/migrating-from-vscode/).
