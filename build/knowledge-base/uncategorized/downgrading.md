# Downgrading your subscription

You're billed for your subscription plan on the first day of the month, so if you downgrade tiers mid-month you'll remain on your current plan until the end of the month. You will be charged for any overages incurred during this month, and then downgrade to your new plan starting from the next billing cycle.

Use the following instructions to downgrade your plan in Kiro.

1. In Kiro, select the profile icon.
2. Choose Manage Plan. You will be redirected to your default web browser to complete the downgrade process.
3. In the browser, choose Update subscription, select which plan you'd like to downgrade to, and then choose Continue.
4. Confirm the details of the plan and then choose Confirm.
5. After confirming your subscription, you can select Return to Kiro to return to the Kiro IDE.
