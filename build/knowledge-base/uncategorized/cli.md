Terminal — 80×24

### Quality code every time

Kiro agents deliver precise code changes across large codebases with the power of [Claude frontier models](/docs/cli/chat/model-selection/) and [advanced context management](/docs/cli/chat/context/).

### Powerful at any scale

Kiro CLI is a lightning-fast coding experience that adapts to how you work, from simple bash commands to complex enterprise workflows.

### Fast, secure development

With powerful [agent steering](/docs/cli/steering/) and [native MCP support](/docs/cli/mcp/), Kiro helps you ship with precision, from prompt to production.

### Precise context, precise code

Using your [knowledge base](/docs/cli/experimental/knowledge-management/), [steering files](/docs/cli/steering/), and [MCP tools](/docs/cli/mcp/), Kiro CLI delivers production-grade code, documentation, and tests that match your requirements.

### Custom agents for every task

[Build task-specific agents](/docs/cli/custom-agents/creating/) optimized for your best practices through pre-defined [tool permissions](/docs/cli/chat/permissions/), [context](/docs/cli/chat/context/), and [prompts](/docs/cli/chat/manage-prompts/).

### Automated actions

Format code, run tests, manage logs, and more—all through automated shell commands.

### Maintain flow across tools

Kiro understands the intent behind your prompts and helps you implement complex features on larger codebases across Kiro tools and [any ACP supported IDEs](/docs/cli/acp/#editor-setup).
