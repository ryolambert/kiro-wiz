By submitting your application for Kiro Pro+, you agree to the promotional offer's terms and conditions.

- From November 17, 2025, 12:01am PT, to December 31, 2025, 11:59pm PT, apply and be approved for access to Kiro Pro+ to receive one years’ worth of Kiro credits based on selection of the Starter, Growth, or Scale tier of the Kiro Pro+ offering. For the avoidance of doubt, applicable overage charges may apply to continue access to the Kiro offering once credits have been exhausted or have expired.
- Offer is only valid for individuals 18 years and older. Excludes individuals living in Argentina, Brazil, France, Germany, Italy, Mexico, Quebec, Russia, Spain, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Syria, and the region of Crimea.
- Offer is limited to companies ranging from early stage to Series B startups who have created an Amazon Web Services ("AWS") Account.
- The email address used to create your AWS Account must be the same email address used for your AWS primary development account, and must include a domain name matching the domain name for your startup's corporate website. If you are a first-time AWS user, create an AWS account to obtain an AWS Account ID.
- By providing your website URL, you authorize us to use automated means to collect publicly available information from your website to evaluate your credit application.
- You will receive notice of your application status at the email address associated with your AWS Account.
- Kiro credits will be issued to your startup, and will not be made available on an individual basis. Failure to provide AWS complete or accurate information may delay or prevent offer fulfillment. Kiro credits will be directly deposited to the provided AWS Account ID immediately upon approval of your application and will activate upon provision. Kiro credits expire 1 year after the date of issuance to your AWS Account. You can view your credit usage in your AWS Account.
- The number of credits you are awarded will be determined by the tier you select. Once you have used all Kiro credits provided under this promotion, your AWS Account will automatically switch to standard Kiro Pro+ billing at the then-current billing rates. If you have any questions, you may contact the AWS Activate Support Team.
- Offer cannot be refunded or re-issued.
- Offer limited to 1 subscription per startup. You may only receive Kiro credits once under this promotion. If you previously applied for this promotion and were rejected, and your eligibility status has changed, you can re-apply if you meet all of the current requirements.
- AWS reserves the right to modify or cancel the offer at any time.
- Offer is non-transferable and may not be resold.
- If you violate any of these terms and conditions, the offer will be invalid.
- Void where prohibited.
- Your information is handled in accordance with the AWS Privacy Notice.
