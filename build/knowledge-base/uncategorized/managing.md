Your Kiro subscription gives you access to powerful AI-assisted development features. Here's how to manage your account and get the most out of your subscription.

## Accessing your billing information

To manage your billing and payment information:

1. In Kiro, select the profile icon.
2. Choose Manage Plan. You will be redirected to your default web browser.
3. In the billing dashboard, you'll find several sections:

- Current Subscription
  - View your active plan details
  - See your next billing date and amount
  - Check your subscription status
- Payment Method
  - View saved payment methods
  - Update or add new credit or debit cards
- Billing Information
  - Update your billing address
  - If applicable, add or update tax ID information
  - Billing information changes will be applicable for future invoices only
- Invoice History
  - View all past invoices and payments
  - Download PDF copies of your invoices
  - See payment dates, amounts, and status

## Updating your payment method

1. In Kiro, select the profile icon.
2. Choose Manage Plan. You will be redirected to your default web browser.
3. Choose Add Payment Method or Edit your existing payment method. You'll be redirected to our secure customer portal where you can update your card information.
4. Enter the details of your new payment method and your billing address.
5. If applicable, complete 3D-Secure authentication.
6. Choose Add to securely store your payment method.

We accept all major credit and debit cards. Your card will be charged in USD currency.

## Viewing billing history and downloading invoices

1. In Kiro, select the profile icon.
2. Choose Manage Plan. You will be redirected to your default web browser.
3. In the Invoice History section, browse through your past invoices, and select an invoice to view its details and download it as a PDF.

## Troubleshooting payment issues

When a payment fails, you'll receive an email notification, your subscription status will change to *"past due"*, and you will lose access to paid features. Our system automatically retries failed payments over several days. Once payment succeeds, paid plan access will immediately be restored and you'll receive a confirmation. You can also reactivate your subscription by updating your payment method and paying any outstanding balance.

If you're experiencing payment issues:

- Check that your card hasn't expired and has sufficient funds
- Update payment information if needed
- Contact your bank to check if they blocked the charge
