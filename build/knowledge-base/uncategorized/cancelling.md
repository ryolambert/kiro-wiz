# Cancelling your subscription

You're billed for your subscription plan on the first day of the month, so if you cancel your subscription mid-month you'll remain on your current plan until the end of the month. You will be put on **Kiro Free** starting from the next billing cycle, and you won’t be charged for a monthly subscription from that point onwards. However, you will be responsible for any overages incurred during your final paid billing cycle.

Use the following instructions to cancel your paid plan in Kiro. To cancel your paid plan, you must switch to the **Kiro Free** tier.

1. In Kiro, select the profile icon.
2. Choose Manage Plan. You will be redirected to your default web browser to complete the downgrade process.
3. In the browser, choose Update subscription, select Kiro Free, and then choose Continue.
4. Confirm the details of the plan and then choose Confirm.
5. After confirming your subscription, you can select Return to Kiro to return to the Kiro IDE.
