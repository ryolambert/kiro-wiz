> Kiro is the AI IDE we trust in a regulated environment. It provides the security foundation and reliability we need to operate confidently under strict regulatory oversight. It has shifted our engineering time from grunt work to impact.

> Kiro gave me momentum. Ideas turned into plans we could trust, and shipping felt calm instead of chaotic. I spend less time herding tasks and more time building, with a level of clarity that sticks from kickoff to release.

> Once I’m confident in a new idea, spec mode lets me be precise on requirements. This precision automatically converts into production-quality code quickly without the undesired AI slop.
