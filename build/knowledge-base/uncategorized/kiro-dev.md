Kiro helps you do your best work by bringing structure to AI coding with spec-driven development.

Kiro gives developers and teams the structure and speed to 10x their output. Build precise context and make your intent explicit with [executable specs](/docs/specs/). Unleash [advanced agents](/docs/chat/autopilot/) to fix bugs in minutes, iterate on features faster, and solve tough technical problems across the most complex codebases.

### Natural prompt to structured requirements

Kiro takes your [natural language prompt](/docs/chat/) and turns it into clear requirements and acceptance criteria in [EARS notation](/docs/specs/concepts/#requirements), making your intent and constraints explicit.

### Architectural designs backed by best practices

Once you’ve iterated on requirements, Kiro analyzes your codebase and comes up with the architecture, system design, and tech stack that meets your needs.

### Discrete tasks that map to requirements

Kiro then creates an [implementation plan](/docs/specs/concepts/#tasks) with discreet tasks, sequenced based on dependencies, with optional comprehensive tests. Ask Kiro to implement each task using [advanced agents](/docs/chat/autopilot/), and watch the magic happen.

Access Kiro agents in your favorite terminal. Build features, automate workflows in seconds, analyze errors, trace bugs, and suggest fixes locally or over SSH—all in a terminal of your choice, in a highly interactive loop that keeps you in flow.

Terminal — 80×24

Delegate tasks to AI agents that [trigger on events](/docs/hooks/types/) such as file save. Agents autonomously execute in the background based on your [pre-defined prompts](/docs/hooks/management/), helping you scale your work by generating documentation, unit tests, or optimizing code performance.

## Go from vibe coding to viable code

[Multimodal chat](/docs/chat/), [spec-driven development](/docs/specs/concepts/), [agent hooks](/docs/hooks/) - Kiro gives you the best tool for the job in a fresh development experience that still feels familiar.

With [specs](/docs/specs/), [steering](/docs/steering/), and [smart context management](/docs/chat/#context-management), Kiro understands the intent behind your prompts and helps you implement complex features on larger codebases, in fewer shots.

Connect to docs, databases, APIs, and more with [native MCP integration](/docs/mcp/), including remote, so you can bring your world where you work.

Configure how you want Kiro agents to interact with each project, or globally, via [steering files](/docs/steering/). Add context, coding standards, preferred workflows or tools with a simple command.

Choose between [Claude Sonnet 4.5](/docs/chat/model-selection/#claude-sonnet-45) for reliable advanced coding and reasoning, or [Auto](/docs/chat/model-selection/#auto-recommended), which uses a mix of frontier models (like Sonnet 4.5 and other specialized models) for intent detection and caching to balance quality, latency, and cost.

Kiro supports [Open VSX plugins, themes, and VS Code settings](/docs/guides/migrating-from-vscode/) in a streamlined AI-ready environment.

Let Kiro [autonomously run large tasks](/docs/chat/autopilot/) on its own without needing step-by-step instructions. You stay in control, especially when running scripts or commands.

See how many credits each prompt consumes, in real-time, so you're always in control of your spend.

Drop an image of your UI design or a photo of your architecture whiteboarding session, and Kiro can use it to guide its implementation.

Draft [commit messages](/docs/editor/source-control/#commit-message-generation) using the agent directly from the source control pane with a single click.

Kiro can [read and interpret](/docs/chat/diagnostics/) syntax, type, and semantic errors, making it easier to iterate and fix bugs.

See code changes as they happen. Approve everything, step through each change, or [make edits](/docs/editor/interface/) with one click.

## Trusted by engineers worldwide

As a startup co-founder and CTO, time is the most important resource. Kiro justifies the use of my time for developing our business critical assets in-house.

Rolf Koski

CTO & Co-Founder

In my role designing AWS Cloud and AI solutions with Terraform and Python, spec-driven development with Kiro has brought code relevancy and quality to a whole new level. We’ve accelerated feature development dramatically, reducing time to customer value from weeks to days. We are excited to welcome Kiro as our newest team member.

Kiro is a strong ally for startups. It naturally turns overlooked docs and specs into robust assets, making growth smoother and future scaling more effective.

Founder & Engineer

I use Kiro for everything - drafting new Terraform modules, tweaking container setups, even writing down random AI ideas at 2 am. But more than anything, it supports how I learn. I’m endlessly curious, and Kiro helps me stay in that learning loop—tinkering, breaking things, fixing them, and then allowing me to share what I learn back with the community.

Adit Modi

Solution Architect

I’ve been blown away by Kiro’s capabilities. The agentic experience is really transformative. From the multimodal inputs that understand context to the complete lifecycle control within the IDE, it feels like I’m working with a senior developer.

Most tools are great at generating code, but Kiro gives structure to the chaos before you write a single line.

In roughly two days, I built a secure file sharing application from scratch. By simply sharing my requirements with Kiro, I was able to create a fully secure application that incorporates encryption and various security coding practices—no additional prompts needed.

I often forget to add unit tests, or update documentation when pushing changes, but with Kiro I can create a hook and it will automatically run those tasks in the background for me, never having to think twice.

As an open source developer, I typically don’t build games, but last night I was able to create one using Kiro. I didn’t have to think too hard about implementation since Kiro handled the logic and enabled me to write code quickly and accurately.

Kiro lowers the barrier to entry, whether that be, you don’t even know how to code, you’re new to coding, or you’re like me and you’re just learning a new tech stack. If something doesn’t make sense to you, or you feel like you are asking a silly question, ask Kiro anyway!

Kiro comes equipped with all the best practices that I would put in my specs, and builds me the application I want, faster.

Thanks to Kiro’s spec-driven development, I was able to go from concept to working prototype in a single weekend.

In just four lines into a spec, Kiro was able to write user stories like a product manager and capture so many details that I didn’t even need to mention, saving me several days of work.

Kiro isn’t just speeding up my work – it’s making me write better code, think more systematically about architecture, and deliver higher quality results while automated workflows happen seamlessly in the background.

Kiro is just more than code. Aside from just listening to prompts and doing things, it can actually work on tasks based on predefined triggers, making the development experience more efficient.
