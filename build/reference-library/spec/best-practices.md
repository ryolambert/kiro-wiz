# Specs Best Practices

> Specs — best-practices

## When to Use Specs

- Complex features requiring formal planning
- Multi-step implementations with dependencies
- Features needing requirements traceability

## Patterns

- Write requirements in EARS notation (WHEN/SHALL)
- Keep acceptance criteria testable and specific
- Link tasks back to requirements for traceability
- Use checkpoints between implementation phases

## Anti-Patterns

- Using specs for trivial bug fixes
- Skipping the design phase for complex features
- Writing vague acceptance criteria without testable conditions
